/** Overall task: Take a number from the user and decide if it is a valid entry then decide if it is a leap year
 *  
 *  1. Ask the user for a year between 1000 and 3000 (including both 1000 and 3000)
 *  2. If the user enters a value that is not between 1000 and 3000, respond with "Invalid input."
 *  3. If the year was valid in step #2, check if it is a leap year (i.e. a year divisible by 4)
 *      -If the year is a leap year (divisible by 4), print "The year is a leap year."
 *      -If the year is not a leap year, print "The year is not a leap year."
 *  4. Check if the year is divisible by 100.
 *      -If the year is divisible by 100, print "The year is a century."
 *      -If the year is not divisible by 100, print "The year is not a century."
